216,Italy,"Black-skinned berry, pipe tobacco and Mediterranean herb aromas waft out of the glass and carry over to the firm linear palate along with morello cherry, licorice and a hint of clove.

218,US,"Pithy, with grapefruit and lemon peel flavors, this wine is deceptively crisp and light on the nose, offering a wealth of body and lushness on the palate, accented with nutmeg and peach.

225,South Africa,"There's a pleasant, toasty seam throughout the nose and mouth of this well-balanced wine, expressed in notes of sweet spice and honeycomb that frame the yellow melon and apple fruit core. It's plush and mouthfilling, but not flabby or overdone, thanks to balancing acidity and an assertive spicy tone that dominates the finish.

230,US,"Orange blossom and flowers lead on this Gewürtz, and on the palate, a citric, lemon edge outweighs the sweet and floral components that would give this wine a prettier edge.

231,Argentina,"Meaty and rubbery, but that's young Bonarda. This is a sound wine with dark berry flavors, raisin and pulsing acidity.

233,US,"There is an odd, piercing edge to the aromas, a mix of acetic acid and pungent herb, with a hint of diesel. Somehow it's not off-putting, just atypical. The light, tart fruit is a mix of rhubarb and cranberry, very earthy and tasting of dirt and bark in the finish.

253,Argentina,"Huge in color and extract, but also a little childish. The nose has gumball, berry jam and a touch of volatility, but after things settle it rests on bold black fruit.

In the mouth, it's mouthfilling but lacks a bit of texture; the flavors include dark plums, vanilla and hints of dried fruits, like figs and dates.

This one is full bodied and rich, with dense plum and chocolate notes that verge on being fudge-like. But those elements are lifted slightly by hints of mint and bacon.

637,France,"A rather perfumed nose hints at the Gewurztraminer that colors this Riesling with rose petal and honeysuckle notes. The co-planted varieties in this vineyard make a smashing duo since they are almost polar opposites: structured, straight-laced Riesling with its fine spine of acidity benefits from the playfulness and charm of aromatic, fleshy Gewurztraminer which in turn is lit up by Riesling's freshness. Really, this is a case where you can have the best of both worlds.",92,45.0,Alsace,Anne Krebiehl MW,Biecher & Schaal 2014 Altenberg de Bergheim Grand Cru White (Alsace),Alsace white blend,Biecher & Schaal

There is concentration and a texture of the finest, purest citrus oil. This is wonderfully mature and ready now but has the stuffing to last. Drink 2016–2020.",92,36.0,Alsace,Anne Krebiehl MW,Domaines Schlumberger 2010 Kitterlé Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),Riesling,Domaines Schlumberger
639,France,"There are mere hints of beeswax and marzipan on the nose. The palate opens into a structured, bright and well-lit space of pear peel, pear juice and a wonderfully bitter edge.

640,US,"Yields tend to be low in this dry-farmed vineyard, which especially struggles during a drought, but the quality is fantastic.

647,Portugal,"This is an impressive, powerful wine. It speaks of the hard landscape of the Douro Superior, with its structure and dark tannins. At the same time, ripe dark fruits push through the still-young tannins giving the potential for a rich, black fruit dominated wine.

1015,US,"A nice tarry funk along with dried mint and menthol cigarette scents characterize the nose of this blend of 63% Cabernet Sauvignon, 33% Syrah and 4% Petite Verdot.

1019,US,"Estate bottled, this assemblage of 77% Cabernet Sauvignon, 13% Cabernet Franc and 10% Petit Verdot opens with a flurry of coconut flake and herb, followed by ripe, rich layers of dark berry and black tea.

1021,Argentina,"Warm, earthy, jammy berry aromas are oaky and bring a note of latex into the fold.

1023,Israel,"This offers aromas of honeydew melon and vanilla. On the palate, gentle flavors of nutmeg, cinnamon and eucalyptus predominate over a bright burst of citrus.

1025,US,"This is a softer Sauvignon Blanc for those not sworn to the grassy side of the grape, as the Buellton-based winery does a lot of barrel-fermenting. Aromas include pressed kiwi and a sour pucker of lime, and the broiled pear flavors prove easy drinking, if not exceedingly complex.",88,42.0,California,Matt Kettmann,Dragonette 2012 Vogelzang Sauvignon Blanc (Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara),Sauvignon Blanc,Dragonette

1033,US,"Sea salt, Bosc pear, apple cider, squeezed lemon and shreds of vanilla frame a leaner nose on this wine from mid-Monterey County.

Clacky tannins make food almost mandatory.",86,12.0,Colchagua Valley,Michael Schachner,TerraNoble 2006 Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Colchagua Valley),Cabernet Sauvignon,TerraNoble
1476,US,"This has light but sweet fruit flavor, leaning heavily toward strawberry and Bing cherry candy. The fruit is a bit mismatched to the tannins, which are thick and chewy, but with additional bottle age the middle may fill out somewhat. It's got a pretty, fruity entry and a substantial, slightly earthy finish; it's just that midpalate that falls a bit short.",86,20.0,Washington,Paul Gregutt,Arbor Crest 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),Cabernet Sauvignon,Arbor Crest
1477,Chile,"A solid wine with a good mix of herbal, cola and red-fruit aromas. It deals spanking red fruit flavors and a sprinkle of vanilla and chocolate on the racy finish.

1478,Australia,"This 60-40 blend features gentle aromas of vanilla and cassis in a medium-bodied, creamy-smooth format.

1479,Chile,"Big, bold, wild and dark, with mild burnt aromas backed by broad blackberry and plum flavors. This represents the fruity, thick style of Syrah, with additional notes of black olive and savory meat pie. It's not flawless but its pounding fruit character will earn its share of fans.",85,9.0,Maule Valley,Michael Schachner,Chilensis 2006 Reserva Syrah (Maule Valley),Syrah,Chilensis
1480,Chile,"Pungent and sharp, and that's exactly the style that Los Vascos has mastered in recent years. This wine tastes very much like a coastal, Casablanca Chardonnay yet it hails from Colchagua. The nose is pithy and citric, and the palate is more of the same. Good mouthfeel and fresh, but green, citrusy and too much like Sauvignon Blanc.",85,12.0,Colchagua Valley,Michael Schachner,Domaines Barons de Rothschild (Lafite) 2007 Los Vascos Chardonnay (Colchagua Valley),Chardonnay,Domaines Barons de Rothschild (Lafite)
1482,Argentina,"Rather sweet and medicinal; the wine comes into form on the palate, which is fairly bright and forward as it pushes raspberry and cherry flavors. Acidity is on the high side, so the feel and finish have some burn. Could use some pizza or meat to help it along.",85,10.0,Mendoza Province,Michael Schachner,Finca Sophenia 2006 Altosur Cabernet Sauvignon (Tupungato),Cabernet Sauvignon,Finca Sophenia

1484,New Zealand,"Shows plenty of weight on the palate, but also an overall lack of intensity to its slightly vegetal—green pea—flavors.

1486,Hungary,"The rich, spicy and savory nose evoke the food for which the country is known, and this wine would undoubtedly pair well with full-bodied, spiced meats and stews. Its full, spicy nose leads into dependable flavors of red berry, wooded spice and pepper, with a slightly bitter, smoked edge. Not a terribly complex wine, but solid and tasty nonetheless.",85,48.0,Villány,Susan Kostrzewa,Bock 2000 Cuvée Barrique Red (Villány),Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Bock

1496,Argentina,"Round, nutty and smooth, with melon, citrus and apple flavors. In this wine's case, organic does not equal complexity.

1497,Argentina,"Timing is everything with this full-bodied PG. Get at it right away and it will still be almost viscous, but it should also show ripe tropical fruit flavors, core acidity and lots of personality.

1499,Chile,"The oak on this wine gives it a strong resin and cinnamon character.

1509,Chile,"Gê is one of Chile's perennial best blends. It mixes Syrah, Carmenère and Cabernet Sauvignon into a lovable, complex whole.

1517,France,"A new-wood-dominated wine, this has a heavy toast character, with extracted licorice and dark chocolate flavors as well as a big black-plum note.

1518,France,"A powerful, wood-aged wine, this shows weighty black fruit and a toasty character. It is concentrated and solid, yet it has a soft and rich side as well.

1519,Chile,"The nose is an attractive mix of cassis and mineral notes. The palate is more racy and wiry than dense and soft, with juicy, flashy flavors of berry, cherry and currant.

The palate of this Cabernet Sauvignon-led blend is tight, pure and rich, and the flavors of toasty black fruits carry accents of licorice and coffee. The finish is spicy, with a licorice note, and the wine's tannic composition suggests that aging is appropriate.

1790,Argentina,"Floral hints, latex, vanilla, oak and ripe berry aromas all show up on a fine bouquet.

1798,Italy,"From one of the best vintages in the last 15 years, this classic Barolo needs to be opened a couple of hours ahead of time to breathe. It's a bit shy on aromas but the palate delivers dried cherry, fig, tobacco, white pepper and black tea flavors. Youthful acidity accompanies silky tannins in this wine that is just starting to develop complexity.

1800,France,"Solid and powerful, it has a great mix of very ripe fruit with dense tannins. Blackberry fruits, laced with licorice and dark chocolate, contrast with a juicy, lightly herbal element.

1802,Portugal,"It seems perverse to plant Gewürztraminer in the Douro and this wine is as much a curiosity as it is attractively perfumed.

It's a solid deal though!",85,28.0,California,Matt Kettmann,Jewelry Box 2012 Chardonnay (Central Coast),Chardonnay,Jewelry Box
1806,Spain,"Cidery aromas are briny. This feels low on bubbles but propped up by citric acidity. Orange and lettuce flavors end in pedestrian fashion, with a note of green herbs.

1807,France,"Lanson suggests adding fruit to this wine or using it as the base for cocktails. It is off dry, ripe and fruity in itself. A touch of toast suggests this bottling is not young.

1810,Spain,"Stone-fruit aromas are the opening, and they're on the full, waxy, fleshy side. This weighs in with low acidity, and that results in broad flavors of papaya and green melon.

1823,France,"Structured and firm, this wine has more in the way of dry tannins than of fruit. It presents a fine skeleton without much flesh, leaving a wine that is tight and extracted.

1827,Spain,"Damp, rubbery aromas of berry fruits and cured meat amount to a weird ensemble. This is decidedly grabby on the palate, with salty, herbal plum flavors.

1828,Spain,"Oaky, jammy aromas are wayward and slightly green. This blend of Tempranillo and Monastrell delivers heavy tannins on a widespread but unfocused palate.

1830,US,"The Blanc de Noir name would suggest it's a sparkling wine; it is not. The label also reads Estate White Wine. It is not. Rather, it is a rosé of Pinot Noir, lightly orange in color.

1838,US,"This herbaceous Cabernet also contains 17% Petite Sirah but doesn't take that variety's character on as much as it does the more herbal Bordeaux grapes, namely Cab and Cab Franc.

1840,US,"From the winery's estate Bell Mountain ranch, a stretch of vineyard that reaches through Alexander Valley to the Russian River Valley, this is mostly Cabernet Sauvignon, blended with Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot.

1891,Australia,"Softer and more approachable than the winery's powerful 2005, this wine offers lush plum, leather and loam notes, accented by a touch of cracked pepper. It's full-bodied and creamy-textured, with a soft finish that invites another sip. Drink now–2012.",89,25.0,South Australia,Joe Czerwinski,Longview 2006 Devils Elbow Single Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Adelaide Hills),Cabernet Sauvignon,Longview
1894,Australia,"Sourced largely from the northern end of the region, this features bold blackberry flavors slightly reminiscent of preserves and marked by dark shadings of cola and chocolate.

1896,US,"This is a high acid style of Chardonnay, reflective of a vintage that was one of the coolest in a decade or more. Crisp and detailed, this offers a classy mix of citrus and apple, wet stone and light baking spices. Hints of nutmeg and cinnamon adorn the fruit, which lingers gently through a citrusy finish.",89,30.0,Oregon,Paul Gregutt,Ponzi 2005 Reserve Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),Chardonnay,Ponzi
1897,Australia,"A very good effort, this may be among the last great values to emerge from Australia, as smaller crops and changing currencies will undoubtedly take their toll. It's remarkable that McLaren Vale fruit can go into a $12 bottle. Black cherry fruit is presented on a medium-bodied, softly tannic frame, embellished by hints of cola and eucalyptus. Finishes soft, with a fine texture of charcoal dust and lingering cassis flavors.",89,12.0,South Australia,Joe Czerwinski,Razor's Edge 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (McLaren Vale),Cabernet Sauvignon,Razor's Edge
1898,Spain,"Plenty of new oak is announced via aromas of coconut, mint, vanilla and burnt toast. but offsetting that is lively berry and cola flavors. As it opens and settles in, you get a wall of fierce tannins that aren't likely to fade any time soon. So unless you have years to cellar this wine, it will likely hold onto its hard, tannic personality. Hold another three years, if possible.",89,150.0,Catalonia,Michael Schachner,Torres 2003 Reserva Real Red (Penedès),Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Torres
1899,Argentina,"Blackberry and cassis aromas share the bouquet with tougher, more masculine notes of earth, rubber and char. Once it opens on the palate, there's ripe raspberry, plum and a nod to the black side of the fruit spectrum. Finishes with a mild kick of tannins and the essence of coffee and pepper. A solid blend of Cabernet and Merlot from the improving Uco Valley.",89,10.0,Mendoza Province,Michael Schachner,Carlos Basso 2006 Dos Fincas Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot (Uco Valley),Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot,Carlos Basso
1900,US,"Complex mixed stone fruits dappled with sweet cinnamon spice lead into a fairly lush midpalate.

1902,Argentina,"Black plum, cola and chocolate define this textbook Malbec. The wine has body, heft and lots of fruit, but also some complexity and character.

1903,Australia,"A crisp medium-bodied Cab with good varietal definition, Strathewen Hill's 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon boasts slightly minty cassis-inflected fruit, vanilla and chocolate notes and a smooth mouthfeel.

1909,Australia,"A real crowd-pleaser, the 2005 Shingleback may not have quite the complexity of the 2004, but it's still a fun, approachable wine.

1915,Chile,"Crusty aromas of black fruits mesh nicely with lemon peel and floral scents. The acidity here is noticeably high, which creates a scouring mouthfeel.

1917,Chile,"Hay, straw, match stick and minerally aromas outweigh this wine's fruit scents by a measurable margin. This is chunky and a bit soft in the mouth, a reflection of 2012's heat.

1920,France,"Solid and tannic, very firm from the opening to the finish. It is based around a dark core of wood and spice as well as more juicy fruit flavors.

1926,US,"This is a tough, chewy Merlot, a bit of a stylistic departure for Walla Walla Vintners. Perhaps it's the addition of Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc, or perhaps just the result of the challenging 2010 vintage in the Walla Walla Valley.

2090,US,"A nicely crafted debut from a new Walla Walla boutique. The blend—two thirds Cabernet Sauvignon, one third Syrah—is becoming a classic in Walla Walla.

2105,Chile,"A little sweet, dense and pasty on the nose, and that's also how the wine plays out. It's a ripe style of Carmenère, with brooding but not overly expressive black-fruit flavors.

2120,US,There's a savage appeal (what the French call sauvage) to this unabashedly rustic Cabernet Franc that was fermented entirely using wild yeasts.

2309,Spain,"One sniff announces a wood pile's worth of toasty, dusty oak. But there's all the bold Tempranillo fruit and classic RDD terroir here to absorb it.

Drink now.",90,50.0,Northern Spain,Michael Schachner,Bodegas Muriel 2004 Viña Muriel Gran Reserva  (Rioja),Tempranillo,Bodegas Muriel
2684,Italy,"This muscular Amarone has an almost overripe fragrance, along with chocolate and vanilla notes. The alcohol is forward on the palate, but it also delivers sweet plum, prune and black pepper flavor, with hints of vanilla and coffee. This is direct and powerfully structured.",90,125.0,Veneto,Kerin O’Keefe,Zenato 2007 Sergio Zenato Riserva  (Amarone della Valpolicella Classico),Red Blend,Zenato
2686,US,"This 95% Cabernet Sauvignon with the balance of Merlot, Syrah and Malbec, is immediately accessible with notes of char, roasted coffee bean and cherry.

2693,Chile,"Fresh and clean, with light, lemony aromas in addition to tropical fruit. The palate is textured and full, with fairly pure apple and pineapple flavors and some nuttiness. Everything works here, including the smooth, lengthy finish.  Best Buy.",87,10.0,Colchagua Valley,Michael Schachner,La Playa 2002 Estate Reserve Chardonnay (Colchagua Valley),Chardonnay,La Playa
2698,Chile,"Creamy aromas of vanilla and pears also carry some typical Sauvignon Blanc pungency. For a rounder style, which it is, it's quite refreshing. The mix across the palate of banana, grapefruit and almonds is attractive, and so is the round, pretty finish. Drink it very soon.",87,10.0,Maipo Valley,Michael Schachner,Santa Ines 2001 Legado de Armida Reserva Sauvignon Blanc (Maipo Valley),Sauvignon Blanc,Santa Ines
2702,Italy,"An open-knit, friendly nose features lots of nectarine and ripe apple scents. Medium-weight, with plenty of stone fruit on the palate, it finishes with a cleansing burst of peppery spice. Try as an apéritif.",87,15.0,Northeastern Italy,Joe Czerwinski,Bortoluzzi 2001 Pinot Grigio (Isonzo del Friuli),Pinot Grigio,Bortoluzzi
2704,Chile,"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Merlot starts off a bit murky and brooding but then displays raspberry and plum fruit, and some big-time heft. A tad oaky and simple, but with grilled meats it should more than do the trick. If you like 'em big and a touch funky, get tattooed.",87,9.0,Colchagua Valley,Michael Schachner,Two Brothers 2001 Big Tattoo Red Red (Colchagua Valley),Red Blend,Two Brothers
2705,Chile,"Heavy and gold in color, with aromas of browned butter, wheat and corn cakes. The bouquet and color are heavy, and so is the palate: There you get oak barrel and toast, but little to no fruit. Even the finish is woody, with just a hint of melon and banana. A good experimental wine for those eager to taste oak; otherwise steer clear.",87,8.0,Rapel Valley,Michael Schachner,Viña Santa Monica 2001 Chardonnay (Rapel Valley),Chardonnay,Viña Santa Monica
2707,Chile,"The initial nosing reveals a char-broiled character along with maple. That nose turns even darker with airing, indicating that no barrel was spared in the making of this wine. The flavor profile is all dark berries and cream, with yet more wood at the heart. On the tail end, it's dry, broad and full of tannins and extract that coat the mouth.

2708,Italy,"A rich, aromatic, honeyed style of Chardonnay, with 100% malolactic fermentation to increase the softness and sweet wood flavors.

2715,Italy,"Despite the modest price, this wine needs some time in the glass or in a decanter to open up.

2718,Chile,"Solid and sturdy, and more big than small, this Syrah runs toward the red-fruit spectrum. But the nose offers dried fruit, herbs and clove, while there's more clove and fennel underneath the fruit on the palate. There's oak throughout, especially on the finish, but it's not overdone. And if many Syrah-based wines need time to settle, this one seems made for immediate drinking.",87,20.0,Curicó Valley,Michael Schachner,Montes 2001 Alpha Syrah (Curicó Valley),Syrah,Montes
2719,Chile,"This Merlot excels beyond its bargain classification by showing purity and a high level of fruit quality.

2727,US,"In many ways, this is a fascinating sip, but the components are a bit confusing altogether. Aromas of minty berries, tobacco, rustic leather and a very strong camphor scent introduce the nose, and then a lively, quite foamy acidity consumes the palate, where flavors of sweet berries are cut by garden herbs and pepper. It's a little too overpowering.",86,29.0,California,Matt Kettmann,Joseph Filippi 2009 Old Vine Zinfandel (Cucamonga Valley),Zinfandel,Joseph Filippi

2732,Chile,"Dusty earth, seashell notes and tomato aromas don't fully announce how snappy, tart and racy this coastal PN is.

2733,US,"This is a juicy and formidably tannic version of the variety, from a famed vineyard known also for Zinfandel.

2741,Chile,"Chunky aromas of tomato, saucy berry fruits, asphalt and tire rubber are somewhat harsh.

The price can't be beat either.",86,23.0,California,Jim Gordon,Bota Box 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (California),Cabernet Sauvignon,Bota Box

2773,Chile,"Prickly, punchy, pryazinic aromas will have you thinking this is Sauvignon Blanc or Spanish Verdejo.

2912,Germany,"Dust and pollen notes linger from nose to finish on this dry, full-bodied Riesling. Apple and pear flavors are a tad savory, but brightened by crisp lemon acidity.

2913,Spain,"Dusty, medicinal berry and plum aromas are open and bright. A juicy but pinched palate features narrow flavors of plum and berry skins, while the finish is rubbery in feel, with astringency as well as bright residual fruit flavors.",86,15.0,Northern Spain,Michael Schachner,Aldonia 2012 Vendimia  (Rioja),Tempranillo Blend,Aldonia
2914,Italy,"Aromas of peach blossom, citrus and a yeasty note of fresh biscuits lead the nose on this 100% Chardonnay.

2916,Spain,"Reduced, stewy, lightly herbal aromas blend berry and tomato scents. The acidity on this five-grape blend is pointed and overriding.

2919,Italy,"Rustic aromas recall wet earth, barnyard and leather with a whiff of ripe, black fruit. The thick palate is rather muddled and delivers both sweet and bitter sensations of prune, overripe black plum, confectionary flavors, vanilla and notes of resin alongside astringent tannins that dry out the mouth.",86,35.0,Veneto,Kerin O’Keefe,Le Bertarole 2010 Podere Cariano  (Amarone della Valpolicella Classico),Red Blend,Le Bertarole
2920,Portugal,"The pink hue is a little flat. That also applies to the palate, with the fruit showing some maturity and hinting at wood aging. It's a rounded style, full in the mouth, with ripe caramel flavors at the end. Drink now.",86,15.0,Port,Roger Voss,Poças NV Poças Pink  (Port),Port,Poças

2924,Chile,"Dusty apple aromas are less citrusy than ideal, and the palate is cidery and tangy. Finishes with heft, length and weight, which all seems a little overbearing given the wine's simplicity. Just good enough but doesn't fully click.",84,10.0,Curicó Valley,Michael Schachner,Carmen 2009 Sauvignon Blanc (Curicó Valley),Sauvignon Blanc,Carmen
2925,Argentina,"Foxy and jumpy smelling at first, with brambly raspberry aromas. The palate feels heavy and baked, with grabby tannins in support of herbal, mildly weedy berry fruit flavors.

2926,France,"In a piece of French wine shorthand, the new appellation of Saint-Bris takes in the old Sauvignon de Saint-Bris wines. The style, though, hasn't changed: an attractive, if rustic type, with crisp gooseberry and grapefruit flavors and a fresh burst of acidity.

2935,Argentina,"Sharp, minty aromas mixed with stemmy red fruit set up a modest, middleweight palate of semisweet, generic red fruit flavors. Quick on the finish, with a spot of green flavor. Good enough but lacks the concentration and deeper aromas and flavors of Urban Malbec.",84,11.0,Mendoza Province,Michael Schachner,O. Fournier 2007 Urban Uco Tempranillo (Uco Valley),Tempranillo,O. Fournier
2941,US,"This is a simple, light take on Syrah, with a little bit of black pepper, a hint of underbrush, but none of the texture and detail of pricier Washington bottles.

2942,Argentina,"Aromas of white grapefruit, celery and other prickly fruits lose steam with airing, while the green apple and lime flavors are solid and offer some sweetness.

2947,Argentina,"Lime and green melon aromas are a bit less than clean and pure, and the palate serves up a pile of jalapeño and bell pepper, with some lime in the background.

2948,US,"This vineyard has proven it can ripen good Malbec, but here it seems as if something has gone sideways. There is a gluey scent underneath the blackberry fruit, and the wine seems chalky and disjointed in the mouth, with more of the band-aid flavors in the finish.",83,26.0,Washington,Paul Gregutt,Gilbert Cellars 2007 Estate Malbec (Wahluke Slope),Malbec,Gilbert Cellars
2949,Australia,"This wine is a bit hard and ungenerous but certainly not lacking in concentration or intensity. Cassis and cedar scents give way to dark, chocolaty flavors.

2950,US,"This is a pretty wine, and the initial flavors are soft and mature, suggesting a wine that's ready to drink now. In the mouth it falls away quickly with a slightly oxidized character that suggests an early fade is on the way.

2951,US,"An exotic bouquet suggests dried roses, brown sugar, cranberry and plum jam. There's a sweetness in the mouth that continues the impression of brown sugar, or maybe a streak of cola. It's an interesting bottle that could develop further or fall off a cliff; it turns a little funky in the finish. More than 12,000 cases were made.",86,37.0,Oregon,Paul Gregutt,Archery Summit 2004 Premier Cuvée Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),Pinot Noir,Archery Summit

Drink now.",86,10.0,Mendoza Province,Michael Schachner,Doña Paula 2006 Los Cardos Syrah (Luján de Cuyo),Syrah,Doña Paula
2956,Australia,"There's a tobacco and tomato leaf character that gives this an almost floral aroma, but also simpler cassis and cherry fruit.

2958,Australia,"This is a perfectly fine example of Clare Valley Cabernet, one that emphasizes refinement and elegance over sheer power and intensity. Cassis, tobacco and a hint of vanilla account for the bulk of the aromatic and flavor interest, and it turns mouthwatering on the finish.

2960,Spain,"In accordance to what 2003 dealt out, this wine is a bit stewy and broad. It shows cola, tree bark and baked fruit on the nose, and then sweet plum and chocolate on the finish. It's not a wine for deep contemplation; drink now to enjoy its robust plumpness.",86,25.0,Northern Spain,Michael Schachner,Campos Góticos 2003 Crianza  (Ribera del Duero),Tempranillo,Campos Góticos
2962,Spain,"Slightly warmer in style, with caramel and vanilla aromas, yet the palate runs more toward freshness, with orange and pineapple standing out.

2964,Argentina,"Better than most Argentinean Sauvignon Blancs, and made in a fuller-bodied style.

2967,US,"A light entry holds flavors of strawberry and tomato leaf, then turns tannic.

2970,Spain,"There's some stewed fruit weighing down this Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon blend, but for the most part it has it going on. Coffee, oak and leather aromas set up a palate of raspberry, plum and chocolate. There's a fair amount of acid for an ‘03, and that lends legs to a wine that might otherwise seem tired.",85,29.0,Central Spain,Michael Schachner,Vitis Terrarum 2003 Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla),Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon,Vitis Terrarum

2973,US,"This is a pretty eastern U.S. Merlot, with its subtle, nuanced flavors of red berry, plum and currant and its approachable, soft tannins.

2979,France,"This Alliance Bourg co-op wine is packed with minty new-wood aromas, this has the potential to be a smooth, polished wine.

2980,France,"Intense notes of ripe red and baked apples make a strong impression. The palate is rich with the same baked apple along with a touch of honey and gingerbread.

2985,US,"This big, dramatic wine has a dark color and bold aromas of wood smoke and black pepper. Flavors are concentrated but also dry and appetizing.

2986,US,"Although one of the cheaper Zins in the winery's line-up, it is showing the best right now, so drink up.

2988,Germany,"Superbly warm weather in 2015 gave an extra boost of sunshine to many of the Mosel's entry-level wines, and the RK is one of the best. Whiffs of freesia and tangerine peel waft from the glasss of this semidry Riesling. It's low in alcohol, yet so honeyed and ripe that flavors of grapefruit and peach seem to slick sumptuously on the palate. Zesty lime acidity freshens a lingering finish.",91,16.0,Mosel,Anna Lee C.

2989,US,"This sensational effort was fermented and briefly aged in neutral oak. The striking package sets it apart from all other Rex Hill wines, and the rich, complex flavors add to the impression that this is something truly special.

3257,US,"Grown in the southern section of the valley in the foothills of the Blue Mountains, this rare varietal bottling from this appellation shows aromas of cranberry, raspberry and citrus, along with some hints of oxidation.

3259,US,"This is box wine taken seriously, even featuring a picture of winemaker Denise Wordenon.

3281,Argentina,"“Cocina” means “the kitchen” in Spanish, and this blend of Malbec, Bonarda and Syrah is definitely a kitchen-sink type of wine.

3285,US,"This 2005 Syrah from Morrison Lane seems a bit lackluster compared with previous efforts. This is smoky and tight, a tannic wine with flavors of lead pencil, green tea and earth.

3316,US,"Lola is a 50-50 Cabernet Sauvignon/Syrah blend, smooth and supple, with a mix of purple berries, black cherry, cassis and smoke. The tannins finish a little green, and the Cab/Syrah combo seems to nullify the clear, varietal expression of either grape, but overall this is a well-crafted wine that could stand nicely alongside a hanger steak.",87,25.0,Washington,Paul Gregutt,Two Vintners 2007 Lola Red Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),Red Blend,Two Vintners

3321,Spain,"A snappy, high-acid wine that pulses with red fruit aromas and flavors. It's sheering, which is normal for the Graciano variety, but it also tastes nice while delivering a bolt of raspberry and red plum flavor. Oak comes up late, providing a counterweight of vanilla and dry spice.

3850,Germany,"A lovely effort from proprietor Raimund Prüm, this plump, creamy-textured spätlese displays ample minerality—there's a distinctly slate-driven note—allied to ripe apple, stone fruit and citrus.

3851,US,"Spicy and assertive, this young, cellar-worthy Pinot Noir just hints at the complexity within.

That said, this is a finely elegant wine, with floral details on the nose and enduring stony notes on the finish that mark it as something special.

3960,US,"The latest version of this popular blend drops the Chardonnay and adds 11% Grüner Veltliner to the Roussanne-Viognier blend. It seems to elevate the aromatics, pushing lush scents of lemon drop, pineapple, and candied orange peel forward.

3969,South Africa,"This is a robust and firmly structured Syrah with medium-coarse tannins and medium-full weight. Meaty and dark with notes of licorice, black currant, sweet spice and a touch of cocoa on the finish. Though it's intense, it still feels like it's holding back a little bit; try after 2012 for a more forward presentation.",90,47.0,Coastal Region,Lauren Buzzeo,Boekenhoutskloof 2007 Syrah (Coastal Region),Syrah,Boekenhoutskloof

3983,Austria,"Big, bold and soft, this is way too heavy. Sure, the Grüner spice is all there, but it is at the expense of a fresh, racy character.

3991,US,"This is very soft upon entry, with remnants of penetrating spicy and herbal flavors that might have punched up the intensity if they hadn't been somehow smoothed over. It's difficult to assess, because many of the right pieces are all here, but somehow they have not jelled. The wine tastes acidic and sharp, with pineapple and citrus dominating, and a chalky, tannic finish.

This was sourced from the 1983 planting, and the relatively old vines and cool vintage deliver a wine with excellent minerality, lift, drive and focus. The fruit is tangy and yellow/green, but perfectly ripe; the acid underpinning is fresh and lively.

4015,New Zealand,"For a wine with such a large volume (over half a million cases were imported to the U.S.), the quality is admirable.

5036,France,"Hugely ripe, this is a dense and potentially intense wine. Its high alcohol brings out a disturbing pepper character that spoils the purity of the rich fruits and mineral texture. It shows the heat of the volcanic soil of Ragen de Thann Grand Cru in its rich fruits and ripe structure. It does need aging, so drink from 2017.",91,53.0,Alsace,Roger Voss,Domaine Schoffit 2011 Rangen de Thann Grand Cru Clos Saint-Théobald Riesling (Alsace),Riesling,Domaine Schoffit

5039,US,"This has a brighter yellow color than most of its peers, more body, riper fruit flavors and—unusual for this variety in America—probably some oak influence.

5040,US,"A classic Napa Valley Chardonnay, this is smooth, rich, balanced and well composed.

Rita Hills),Chardonnay,Santa Barbara Winery
5048,US,"Fruity frills of strawberry surround a core of black New Mexican chiles, with cinnamon and clove emerging the longer one sniffs.

5049,US,"This is a delicious Chardonay. It dances in pear, peach and lemon notes. Balanced and addictive, it's easy to love and not overly complicated at all.

5051,US,"With rich melon aromas, ripe apple flavors and a soothing, almost soft texture, this wants some rich, sophisticated cooking to go with it, like sautéed fish with a classic French sauce.

5054,Portugal,"The Reserva version of Mural makes a powerful statement. Dark in color and packed with concentrated fruit, it is full of tannins as well as brooding black-plum flavors.

5055,Portugal,"This wine is a fine exposition of the structure and density of a serious Douro wine. A field blend, it is packed with dark berry fruits and sweet tannins, with a strong mineral element that reflects the tough schist of the vineyards. It's drinkable now, but the wine will be better in 2016.",91,47.0,Douro,Roger Voss,Quinta do Sagrado 2008 VT '08 Red (Douro),Portuguese Red,Quinta do Sagrado
5056,US,"Made from a mix of vineyards across the Napa Valley, this pays tribute to the early days of grape growing in the region and is a wine equally worthy of recognition. Exhibiting dark cherry stone and wild strawberry aromas, the palate is complex, tannic and round, a subtle suggestion of smoke on the finish balanced by bright acidity.",91,35.0,California,Virginie Boone,Robert Biale 2012 Founding Farmers Zinfandel (Napa Valley),Zinfandel,Robert Biale
5057,US,"This is a lightly aromatic wine, with notes of lees, apple, mineral and spice.

Sullivan,Savage Grace 2013 Dineen Vineyard Malbec (Rattlesnake Hills),Malbec,Savage Grace
5059,US,"There's been no price increase for this outstanding value, but the quality keeps going up and up. It's packed with juicy red berry and cassis fruit—supple, tangy, deep and lingering.

5061,US,"This vintage of the winery's Sauvignon Blanc doesn't reflect the tropicality that's started to define the region. It has more warmth to the nose than the grassy pungency common elsewhere, but the stronger differences are on the palate, with cooked apple, squeezed lemon and a brisk acidity, though not a particularly long finish. Altogether, this is a mellow, subdued wine.",87,21.0,California,Matt Kettmann,Happy Canyon Vineyard 2012 Sauvignon Blanc (Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara),Sauvignon Blanc,Happy Canyon Vineyard
5062,Portugal,"Quite why Smart Dog is a good name for a wine is a mystery. The wine itself a rich, soft Syrah with attractive ripe blackberry and plum flavors and soft, finely integrated tannins.

5065,Italy,"Aromas of underbrush, espresso and toasted oak carry over to the palate along with raw red berry. But there's not enough fruit richness to stand up to the astringent tannins and racy acidity.",87,65.0,Piedmont,Kerin O’Keefe,Bava 2010 Scarrone  (Barolo),Nebbiolo,Bava

5067,Argentina,"Spunky, youthful aromas of wild berry and currant are aggressive but fresh in style.

It finishes in the same style.",87,14.0,Mendoza Province,Michael Schachner,Bodega Norton 2012 Barrel Select Malbec (Mendoza),Malbec,Bodega Norton
5068,Portugal,"There is a strong barnyard aroma here, although the palate is cleaner and more modern. With rich tannins and a dark plum character, it's ripe and structured.

5073,Argentina,"Lychee and melon aromas are proper for Torrontés. And while this has Viognier and Chardonnay in the blend, it's Torrontés that dominates via a spritzy, citrusy mouthfeel and flavors of lychee, nectarine and citrus fruits.

5077,France,"The wine is all juicy fruit, black cherries with just a modicum of tannin to hold it together. It's fresh, ripe and immediately attractive.

5082,Spain,"Snappy, dry red-fruit and citrus aromas are a good opening. The palate is fresh and bouncy, with punchy pomegranate and grapefruit flavors.

5083,France,"This wine is heavily spiced from its wood aging. Fresher fruit flavors do come through to give black currants, bright acidity as well as firmer fruit structure.

5086,Italy,"An unusual medley of aromas include orange peel, dill, mint, thyme, espresso and oak. The palate offers coffee, toasted oak and sugary vanilla but it doesn't have much fruit richness. Astringent tannins give a short, bitter finish that dries out the mouth.",87,90.0,Piedmont,Kerin O’Keefe,Parusso 2010 Bussia  (Barolo),Nebbiolo,Parusso

5095,Chile,"Maray Chardonnay is crisp and mineral-driven on the nose, but not overly fruity.

It's a modest Chardonnay with finesse but not a whole lot of flavor.",86,20.0,Limarí Valley,Michael Schachner,Maray 2012 Limited Edition Chardonnay (Limarí Valley),Chardonnay,Maray
5098,US,"Hailing from the cool 2011 vintage, this Cabernet—which includes healthy doses of Malbec and Syrah—is light in style with notes of herbs and currant.

5100,Chile,"Despite showing dusty plum and cherry aromas, this comes across lean on the bouquet, a defining characteristic that's confirmed on the palate via zesty, crisp acids and raw, tangy, herbal red-fruit flavors.

5104,Chile,"Despite cold conditions in 2011, this Pinot is dark in color and full on the nose, where heavy, raisiny black-fruit aromas hold court.

5105,US,"In Spain, Albariño is usually a steely, bone dry, sea-inflected white wine. Here it is made in an off-dry style, with 10 g/L residual sugar. The sweetness masks any apparent varietal specificity, resulting in a pleasant, but generic white wine.",86,22.0,Washington,Paul Gregutt,Castillo De Feliciana 2012 Albariño (Columbia Valley (WA)),Albariño,Castillo De Feliciana
5107,Chile,"Minty aromas rest on top of scratchy raspberry scents.

5112,Italy,"This full-bodied Barbera has ripe black-cherry aromas nuanced with toast and coffee notes.

5116,Austria,"There is something both earthy and berry fruited on the nose: both dried and fresh fruit shine with richness. There is a totally unusual, lovely bitter edge to this fruit, like a marzipan richness at the edge of tart but with ripe fruit. Take this into your treasure chest of vinous curiosities: It more than deserves its place. This is dry but rich, tart but generous, and comes with its very own strong and forceful personality.",92,40.0,Thermenregion,Anne Krebiehl MW,Johanneshof Reinisch 2015 Satzing Rotgipfler (Thermenregion),Rotgipfler,Johanneshof Reinisch

5121,US,"Concentrated, well structured and not too full bodied, this is an almost architectural wine in how it fills out the palate and clings to the taste buds.

5122,US,"From a block planted in 1910 consisting of hearty portions of mixed blacks, this wine is abundantly floral in rose petals, with a plummy core dusted in smoky oak.

5123,Austria,"There are a number of intriguing notions on the nose: There is something nutty and rich, something mellow and yeasty, something green and lively, all tinged with the juicy ripeness of yellow-stone fruit.

5126,Austria,"The nose is tightly closed, yet there is the suspicion of fine fruit. The grippy palate brims with peppery dark-plum fruit and very fine distinct tannins that give this a taut, rigid frame that still needs to relax. This is unusual in so far that it is a Cabernet Franc from Austria, grown on slate. It works well: The tannic structure and fruit are fully expressed. This needs bottle age and will blossom into a far more relaxed and fruitful wine.

5130,France,"Owned by Beaune merchant Louis Jadot, this cru estate produces some impressive wines. While its alcohol is excessive for a Beaujolais, it wears its power well. The black plum fruit and tannins from wood aging that are still very present will soften over the next year to give a rich generous wine with a style that is Burgundian rather than traditional Beaujolais.

5434,Argentina,"Reedy aromas of olive, leather and oak are less than fruity and lush. This has a hard, edgy, abrasive mouthfeel along with pinched, salty flavors of plum and berry fruits.

5435,US,"A joint offering from winemakers Mitch Cosentino and Paul Scotto, this is a blend of 75% Cabernet Sauvignon, 13% Merlot and 12% Cabernet Sauvignon, all grown in the Oak Knoll District.

5436,Argentina,"Smoke, rubber and spice aromas mix with ripe berry scents to form a solid and impressive bouquet.

5437,Chile,"This wine consistently scores in the upper 80s. This vintage is dealing hard spice and herbal aromas along with tight-grained oak scents. Fresh but tannic, with bite and juicy, racy flavors of berry matched by woodspice.

5439,Argentina,"Concentrated and jammy smelling, with a note of iodine to go with racy black fruit aromas. Dense as night in the mouth, with gamey, roasted berry flavors.

5440,France,"Peach and lemon combine in this superripe Chablis. Reflecting the warm vintage, the wine is soft, laced with lime juice acidity and hinting at vanilla and thyme.

5442,US,"Macari's supple, vanilla-scented Cab Franc is upfront and approachable in its sour cherry fruitfulness, yet boasts some complexity with layers of ripe, brambly wood, dust and dark floral notes.

5466,Spain,"The nose on this round, medium-bodied wine is defined by sweet oak and milk chocolate. In the mouth, it's chunky and ripe, with raw tannins.

5493,Austria,"The restrained aromatics of wet grass and gentle smoke are the only reminders that this is Sauvignon Blanc.

5498,Spain,"This dynamite Tempranillo hails from a top producer and a top vintage. Aromas of toasty oak, graphite, coffee and blackberry feed into a rugged but generous palate fueled by firm tannins.

It's 100% varietal, drawing upon equal portions of fruit from all three, and it's a magnificent combination.

5557,US,"Yes, this does not shy away from the herbal bite often found in Oregon Pinot.

5558,South Africa,"A Bordeaux-style blend made from 50% Cab Sauv, 30% Merlot and 20% Cab Franc and aged in new French oak for 24 months, this ripe and lush wine is ready for drinking now with easygoing black cherry and blackberry fruit aromas and flavors laced with notes of pepper, licorice root, tobacco leaf and soft leather.

5560,Austria,"The most impressive of the range of wines from Laurenz Moser V. It is tight with minerality, pepper and apple skin flavors.

5563,Argentina,"Blackberry and rubber aromas are friendly and forward, with spice added in for good measure.

5564,US,"That this small-lot Lodi producer has ventured out to the Russian River Valley for Zinfandel says something here and it says it with finesse, this being austere for Zin, not jammy, with enviable structure and a nice lift of black cherry, spicy cola and earth at the end.",90,28.0,California,Virginie Boone,McCay Cellars 2008 Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),Zinfandel,McCay Cellars

5583,Argentina,"Butter and dill are the first aromas to make themselves noticed, and below that there's raw oak and lighter-weight fruit notes. The palate shows ample resin and wood notes along with pepper and spice. It's a good wine with serious intent, but it seems a little overwooded and a tiny bit green. Cabernet Sauvignon leads the blend, with Merlot and Cab Franc filling it out.",87,35.0,Mendoza Province,Michael Schachner,Luigi Bosca 2004 Gala 2 Red (Mendoza),Cabernet Blend,Luigi Bosca
5586,Argentina,"A little big and heavy, but that's the style that Kaiken has pushed since arriving on the market a few years ago. This version has baked-fruit aromas backed by lemon peel and espresso, while the palate is rich, dark and syrupy, but also oaky and tannic. Seems to want to offer more than it can deliver. The 14.5% alcohol level tells you that it's a big boy.",86,14.0,Mendoza Province,Michael Schachner,Kaiken 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza),Cabernet Sauvignon,Kaiken
5587,US,"There is just 9% Cabernet in the blend. Smooth and light, with lean flavors showing herb and bark.

5590,US,"This is a perfectly drinkable wine, with good fruit from a great vineyard. It's a bit minty and chalky; let's say rustic.

5593,Germany,"Hints of honey and orange marmalade on the nose suggest a wine moving toward maturity at a rapid pace, and one gets a similar impression from the palate, which shows similar development.

5600,US,"Among the single-vineyard 2008 Pinots from Rex Hill, this is the lightest in flavor and style. Ripe strawberry fruit, medium-bodied, is buttressed with generous natural acidity.

5618,Australia,"Well priced for the quality, Chapel Hill's Shiraz-Grenache is barely a blend, with only 10% Grenache. It comes across as a nicely complex, easy-drinking Shiraz, marrying mulberry fruit with hints of chocolate, cracked pepper and fresh herbs.

5619,France,"New wood overwhelms the aromas, and it also dominates the palate of this wine. It just keeps on the right side of drinkability because the spice merges into pear flavors to give an intriguing nutmeg character, while the aftertaste offers freshness. The wine needs at least a year to blend together.",90,58.0,Burgundy,Roger Voss,Château de Fuissé 2006 Les Brulés  (Pouilly-Fuissé),Chardonnay,Château de Fuissé
5620,Spain,"Smooth and sweet, like a cream Sherry is supposed to be. On the nose, this one easily shifts from ripe apricot and peach fruit to nuts and saline. The palate starts with a blast of coffee and mocha and then folds in brown sugar and spice. Sweet, long and generous, with accents of cinnamon, clove and mild chocolate.

5623,Australia,"Henschke is best known for its red wines, but the 2005 Louis Sémillon shows they know a thing or two about whites as well. It combines some toasty, smoky characters with herbal notes on the nose, then develops flavors of wax, spice and citrus, lingering elegantly on the finish. Tasty now, but might develop even more interesting complexities with additional age.",90,27.0,South Australia,Joe Czerwinski,Henschke 2005 Louis Semillon (Eden Valley),Sémillon,Henschke
5626,Austria,"Though Grüner doesn't have a reputation in Austria for ice wine as do other varieties, based on the strength of this wine, maybe it should.

5627,Spain,"A classy Sherry with full, attractive hazelnut and peanut oil aromas. The palate holds to that nuttiness while introducing maple and toffee flavors.

5637,US,"The estate reserve is simply a barrel selection that the winery feels represents the top 10% of their estate-grown Pinot Noir. Basically it offers quite similar flavors; for the extra money you get more butterfat, more cherry fruit and a little less herb. What it gains in power, the wine loses in detail and nuance; depending upon your own palate preferences, the regular estate might be the better value.",90,45.0,Oregon,Paul Gregutt,Apolloni 2006 Estate Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Pinot Noir,Apolloni
5640,Spain,"Ripe, sweet and stylish, with blackberry, root beer and herb aromas. Bulky yet balanced, with black cherry fruit that comes at you in jammy style.

5645,Spain,"Fresh, ripe, inviting and 180° opposite of this producer's white cavas, which seem bubbly and fizzy compared to this balanced, subtle, even smoky offering.

5646,US,"Retour relies on fruit sourced from so-called “old vine” Pinot vineyards. It's full, fleshy, round and brightly fruity, with plenty of spicy chocolate from extended barrel aging.

5651,Austria,"The inviting notion of gently sun-ripened yellow plums on the nose draws you in. The palate follows this with gentle, juicy but balanced ripeness, featuring mirabelle plum and pear.

5656,US,"There is tons of potential for this varietal in the hot eastern reaches of Paso Robles. Light peach and Pink Lady apple aromas start off the easy-to-enjoy nose.

A gravelly minerality and rising texture on the finish complete the picture.",90,24.0,California,Matt Kettmann,Broken Earth 2015 Verdelho (Paso Robles),Verdelho,Broken Earth
5657,Canada,"Sourced from a single vineyard on Oliver's North Bench, this was fermented and aged in one-quarter new French oak barrels.

5665,France,"From an small estate that also has vines in Chénas and Saint-Amour, this is a firmly tannic wine that also has attractive juicy red-berry fruits.

6573,France,"A rich, mouthfilling,  sophisticated wine. The secret is in the balance, with the concentrated fruit flavors—dried apricot, mango and lemon—in just the right proportion.

6578,US,"More powerful and potent than the '04, this simply has more juice, more depth, more power and more detail than any previous Sheridan wine. The fruit is exceptional—dense black cherry and cassis, with a sense of compact layering that promises great aging potential. This was 30 months in oak but does not seem oaky in any way. It already has the balance, the polish and the length to justify long-term cellaring.

It's detailed in the manner of a Pauillac, thick cassis fruit with deep veins of iron, cedar, licorice and a just a hint of silage. The fruit is dark and dense, but with breathing you'll find it begins to open into a splendid blend of black cherry, cassis and mountain berry flavor.

7098,Portugal,"Fresh and perfumed, this wine has fine acidity along with bright berry flavors. The freshness suggests it is still young and needs to broaden out with its juicy, black currant aftertaste.

7101,France,Frothy fizz carries fresh lemon and lime scents to the surface. The palate has the same citric flavor profile and is diffuse with lots of bubbles—which exaggerates the lightness of the dry palate even more.

7104,US,"A rare grape in Oregon, this is a bright garnet shade and scented with cranberry and raspberry fruit. Acidity brings significant snap to the flavors, so much so that for many tasters it will show best with some greasy/smoky grilled meats.

7121,France,"Tannins form a dark barrier to start this wine. It is still young, dense with chocolate as well as fruit flavors, showing the bitter, tough flavors that come from too much extraction.

7445,New Zealand,"An eccentric version of Marlborough Riesling that tastes reminiscent of Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc, with a green, underripe quality and some goosberry aromas on the nose.

7448,Spain,"Sometimes concept exceeds the wine itself, and this may be a case in point. The blend is odd, and the fact that each grape comes from a different part of Spain is potentially more odd. As for the wine, it has a nice perfume to it, courtesy of the Rhone varieties in the mix. And while the cherry/berry fruit is forward, it's maybe too sweet and basic in terms of length, structure and mouthfeel. Still, it's worth a try for the experimental tasters out there.",85,10.0,Catalonia,Michael Schachner,Bodegas Concavins 2000 Proyecto 4 Red (Conca de Barberà),Red Blend,Bodegas Concavins
7449,Chile,"Aromas of match stick and green herbs don't deliver much fruit. This feels round and regular, with grassy flavors along with hints of green bean and canned pea.

7456,Spain,"Cherry and raspberry aromas are also stalky and gamy, a likely reflection of the 75% Syrah in this blend with Garnacha.

7486,Argentina,"Rhubarb and tomato leaf are strongly present on the nose, followed by grassy flavors and a hollow, thin mouthfeel.

7506,US,"This full-bodied but far from heavy wine has wonderful aromatic complexity, evoking Bing cherries, black tea, clove and pine forest, while the flavors gush with red cherry and rhubarb.

7521,Portugal,"This is an initially smooth wood-aged wine that is intense, concentrated and packed with power and tannins. It is rich and full of brooding dark plum and dense with structure.

7557,Spain,"Roasted and baked on first blush, but then the wine's complexity and use of unusual Mallorcan grape varieties take over. Along the way there's flavors and aromas of prune, earth, leather, spice and Mediterranean terroir. It's also bringing tobacco and leaf notes to the table.

7577,Chile,"Elements of this thick, ripe, almost late-harvest SB succeed. The palate is creamy and layered, and it works that angle to its advantage.

7595,Chile,"Mushroom and charcoal dot the nose, but with that comes just a modicum of fruit. The palate is a bit bland even if it's far from offensive, and so is the finish.

7601,Chile,"Lightly fruity in the nose, yet sharp on the palate. For a reserve wine, it's noticeably thinner and more linear than the regular Sauvignon Blanc.

7680,US,"Sourced entirely from the Chelle den Millie vineyard, the grapes were picked and processed specifically for rosé. A deep, delicious and rather potent summer wine, it captures the brisk cherry fruit without entangling it in too much tannin or herb.

7705,Spain,"Fairly ripe and deep smelling, yet it's more racy and lean in the mouth. There's good berry fruit to this Tempranillo-led wine, but it turns kind of sharp and sheering on the back palate.

7707,Spain,"This blend of 85% Tempranillo and 15% Cabernet Sauvignon is light and leafy but not dirty or harsh. It's a thin-sided, tangy sort of wine with as much citrus as there is berry fruit.

8482,Germany,"If there's any quibble with this wine, it's that the aromas and flavors remain in a very narrow range, from struck flint to citrus.

8494,Spain,"A bit unusual and confusing, but that's because it hails from the Rioja region. The nose is herbal and mustardy, with green aromas leading to a cidery palate of apples and spice.

8510,New Zealand,"Spy Valley's 2007 Envoy Pinot Noir is an attractive wine, featuring an exterior of brown sugar, dry leaves and coffee and a fruit-filled cherry center.

8523,US,"This is a dark, intensely astringent wine with so much grape and oak tannin that it's challenging to enjoy now.

9309,Chile,"You can't compare Borobo to anything else because what else is a blend of Carmenère, Cab Sauvignon, Syrah and Pinot Noir? Overall, this is a polished wine with tobacco, balsam wood and cedary berry aromas. The palate is soft and rich, with mellow tannins. Flavors of spice, berry and plum are slightly baked, and the finish keeps the mellow, fruity vibe going.

9311,France,"This is the most impressive Chante-Alouette I can recall, boasting layers of honeyed pineapple fruit, the barest hint of fresh, just-golden toastiness and notes of gingered apricot. It's full bodied and lush on the palate, ending long and mouthwatering. It should drink well into 2015, but expect it to close up only to re-emerge between 2020 and 2030.",92,109.0,Rhône Valley,Joe Czerwinski,M.

9312,Austria,"Bright, zesty lemon appears alongside yellow Mirabell plum that also pervades the palate. There is linear focus, as befits an icewine made from Riesling—and if you have desserts that feature confit lemon, this is what you need. Incredible that something so rich should be so wonderfully light at the same time.",92,50.0,Niederösterreich,Anne Krebiehl MW,Markus Huber 2013 Eiswein Riesling (Niederösterreich),Riesling,Markus Huber
9313,Austria,"Sultry notions of honeycomb, pine sap and something more tropical—perhaps pineapple, perhaps passion fruit—converge in an incredibly concentrated and at the same time tight and light-footed palate. Passion fruit notes intensify on the palate and while this is very sweet, racy, zesty acidity holds wonderful sway.

9329,US,"In this fruit-forward vintage, it's not surprising to find that what shines here are the bright, spicy and tart flavors of strawberries, raspberries and cherries.

9372,Spain,"Vibrant to the point of spritzy, with more tartness than cushion. This is a sharp rendition of Viura that emphasizes grapefruit and lemon.

9758,South Africa,"Fynbos and lime leaf aromas are front and center on the nose of this wine, but are grounded by fruity tones of tart gooseberry and plum. The nervy palate boasts a soft astringency in lime rind and fresh herb flavors, framed by bright acidity and just enough fruit flavor to give subtle weight to the mouthfeel.

9766,Argentina,"A studly Malbec sourced from the Altamira section of the Uco Valley, then aged 18 months in new French oak. Much of this wine is fermented in plastic bins (not tanks), and the affiliated intensity grabs your attention. The blackberry flavors are potent and backed by heavy chocolate and toast.

9773,France,"Wines from Morey-Saint-Denis should be opulent in 2005, and this wine has opulence in spades. It fills the mouth with rich red plums, red cherries and some cranberry juice to give an edge of dryness. Maybe complexity is edged out by all this juicy fruit, but the tannins do firm up the wine, which should certainly age 10 years or more.",92,93.0,Burgundy,Roger Voss,Bouchard Aîné & Fils 2005  Clos de la Roche,Pinot Noir,Bouchard Aîné & Fils

9781,France,"For a Savigny, this is surprisingly firm and tannic, the wine's structure an impressive edifice of dry tannins and firm cranberry and plum skin flavors.

9782,France,"Intensely perfumed, this wine shows both strength and great elegance. The raspberry flavors float over a light structure of some dry tannins.

9783,Germany,"This is a rather big and burly wine for a Mosel spätlese, weighing in at 11.5% alcohol. And while it shows plenty of power, it also shows nuance in its aromas and flavors, which range from baked fruit, honey and spiced marmalade to oily, mineral essences.

9788,US,"The grapes come from three very widely separated vineyard sources. The Klipsun, says winemaker Marie-Eve Gilla, is for the backbone and tannins; the Pepper Bridge gives dried herbs and tighter tannins; and the Alder Ridge is more European and fills out the midpalate. This is showing very well, and has clearly benefited from the extra bottle age. It's beautifully integrated, with the tannins substantial but polished.

It's harvested about three weeks earlier than most high-end fruit, resulting in core raspberry flavors and a certain redness of character.

It brightens them with wondrous lemon freshness and boosts them with a poised dose of residual sweetness. It's an unusual wine that does not really fit any category but sits in a delicious aromatic off-dry class of its own.

The zesty freshness of the citrus fruit always has the upper hand on this energetic, exuberant late harvest wine and counters the residual sweetness perfectly. Killer acidity and utter concentration create a magnetic, delicious, age-worthy wine. The finish is off dry and refreshing, with a sweetish glint here and there.

The palate has that same alluring aromatic spectrum that unites utter freshness with exoticism. This seems light but also packs an incredible punch. There is energy and verve on the midpalate, which has an utterly compact, concentrated but fluid texture. Bright zestiness illuminates the entire palate.

There is something crystalline about this, something fine-boned and delicate that nonetheless has absolute power to convince. This is simply wonderful.

The palate is dry but brims with ripe lemon oil and fresh lemon fruit. This is streamlined and impactful, with a commanding, overarching freshness that only enforces the inherent power of this site more. For now this is tightly wound and still closed, majoring on its ample lemon charm but this needs bottle age to let the myriad notes promised on the nose unfold on the palate.

The palate comes in with gentle, subdued sweetness, boosting ripe pear notes before revealing fir honey bitterness and tangy grapefruit zest. A warm sandalwood-spiced core is still tightly closed, holding further stores of fruit and spice and signalling lasting power and barely tamed energy. While aromas are enticing now this deserves cellaring to come into its own. There is much drive and a dynamic citrus freshness wills you to sip more. This draws you in dangerously.

9909,England,"Touches of vanilla, cream and lovely hints of oatmeal allude to developing, evolving autolytic notes. These are edged with pure lemon, giving equal expression to emollience and freshness. On the midpalate the creamy, generous richness of yeast comes through, providing stucture and a canvas against which tart apple and Amalfi lemon can play. Depth and serious intent shows amid the sensuously fine fizz. Although this wine is refreshing and bright now, more bottle age will make it even more alluring.

9912,South Africa,"Only 95 cases were made of this Bordeaux-style blend of 43% Cabernet Sauvignon, 33% Malbec and 24% Cabernet Franc. It's a stellar example of the high-end and highly cellarable wines that can come out of South Africa, oozing with depth, concentration and complexity, all in a harmonious, balanced package. It's dark and brooding right off the bat, boasting firm, tight blackberry, cherry and cassis fruit that's coupled with hints of raspberry sauce, pressed violets and baking spice. The palate is strong and packed with black fruit flavors that lead into a long, evolving finish of char, espresso bean, cigar and woodspice.

The palate adds a sonorous and pleasant bitterness to this, reminiscent of fir honey, while the floral overtones of honeysuckle shimmer everywhere. There is quite some warmth and energy in this wine, smouldering at the very core. This is lovely now but is sure to last with all its brooding power.

9914,France,"A tender notion of slightly bitter, dark fir honey appears first before a touch of smoke and ripe peach come in. The off-dry palate uses its sweetness to underline the rich peachy fruit that also has a touch of golden mirabelle. The big bold palate is concentrated and energetic, pervaded by a streak of zesty lemon freshness that keeps this from becoming too rich. There is undeniable drive here, and a very lasting persistent length of peach and lemon flavors which will develop much more with bottle age.

9915,France,"A flinty touch of promising reduction still hovers on the nose but cheeky floral and fruity hints of honeysuckle, jasmine and peach shimmer through. The palate unites all of these aromatic notions on a textured, layered and concentrated palate. The hints of honeysuckle spice are intensified by the ripe zestiness of Amalfi lemon and tangerine. The finish is dry and long, with ample refreshment from these gorgeous citrus notes. This is glorious now in its youthful exuberance but has the concentration, structure and fruit to age beautifully.

9918,France,"The nose opens with a concentrated hit of ripe clementine peel, underneath this notions of mirabelle and pear shimmer. The palate is concentrated and full but appears much lighter—a combination of fresh acidity and an alluring touch of residual sweetness do their best to add a spring to the step of this unusual but captivating wine. Scintillating hints of mandarin peel, honeysuckle and kumquat make this incredibly moreish. The finish is off dry to medium sweet. Lovely now, but it's sure to last.

All of these notions are joyously bundled on the concentrated dry palate that is brightened with even more zesty lemon freshness. There is drive here and an arrow-like structure that is energetic and totally refreshing. Uncompromising freshness, expressed with exuberant citrus charm, enlivens everything.

9920,France,"Now just approaching maturity, this floral, aromatic wine is superb. Very dry, very crisp and with delicious lemon and green-apple freshness, the wine also has a strongly mineral character that comes from the chalk soil of the Côte des Blancs.

9923,France,"Just beginning to mature, this balanced, ripe wine is complex, with bright acidity, toast and pear and green-plum fruits.

9925,US,"This wine comes alive on the expansive, fleshy palate of black pepper and olive tapenade flavors.

9926,France,"What a heady nose. Tangerine peel, hay flowers and ripe apples all dance and swirl across the senses. The palate takes the swirling fruit and fragrance up a notch, heightened with the intensity of tangy lemon freshness.

9927,US,"This is perfumed with lovely violets and tight layers of mixed berries, currants and hints of truffle. It's young and muscular, with a pleasing chewy texture to the tannins. There is the sense that time will unfold the flavors and add nuances of herb and earth, capturing the varietal notes that can be   obliterated by over-ripe fruit and too much new oak.",90,32.0,Washington,Paul Gregutt,Tamarack Cellars 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),Cabernet Sauvignon,Tamarack Cellars
9928,US,"A full-boat, five-varietal Bordeaux blend. It's nicely balanced, and retains some inviting aromas of violets and candied rose petals, leading into a lip-smacking, fruit-driven mid-palate with blueberries, boysenberries and a whisper of saffron and chocolate. There is plenty of acid underpinning, and a judicious use of barrels that keeps the fruit front and center.

9932,Germany,"In really warm years like 2006, wines from the cool Saar valley often excel.

9933,Germany,"Impressive for its minerality, this wine offers up aromas of petrol, honey and slate rather than the fruit-driven notes of many Rieslings.

9940,US,"Very ripe flavors of berries and figs dominate this Cab-centric Bordeaux blend, along with intriguing side notes suggesting melon and cassis, smoke and mocha. It's a big, sexy wine, its fruit flavors backed with thick, ripe, but chalky tannins.

9941,Austria,"This is serious Blaufränkisch, a ripe, firmly structured wine that shows a dry edge of solid tannins before you get to the ripe, red fruits.

10118,US,"This alcoholic wine (15.9%, and you can taste it) is also tongue-scrapingly tannic.

10145,Portugal,"Still with its firm tannins in place and with layers of wood aging flavors, this is obviously a young wine.

10150,Italy,"Bracing and tightly wound, this opens with subdued aromas of pressed rose, resin and a whiff of exotic spice.

10174,US,"Co-fermented with Viognier (for the first time at Ste. Michelle), this aims for a brighter, softer style of Syrah. It's plenty soft, pleasantly accessible, and lightly toasty.

10195,US,"Although plummy fruit dominates the nose, if you take an extra moment or two you can ferret out a lot more: mint, leather and vanilla, for example.

10196,Portugal,"From the Setúbal Peninsula, this 100% Periquita is bright and cherry-laden. Soft and velvety in texture, yet with sufficient acidity to accompany food.

11354,Argentina,"While this opens with harmless aromas of lychee and tropical fruits, the palate sizzles with sharp citric acidity.

11376,US,"Though the vineyard sources—Stillwater and Conner Lee—are first-rate, this wine seems a bit disjointed at the moment.

11402,US,"Lovely aromatics suggest wet stone, raspberry and pomegranate. This is a sleek, subtle wine.

12214,France,"Tight and tannic, this wine is still young. The stalky fruit is cut with intense acidity coming from the crisp black currant flavors.

12525,US,"A Bordeaux-style blend, tart and fruity, with an unusual fruit flavor mix that starts with citrus and orange and runs into bright berries.

12530,Germany,"While 1976 in Germany was a benchmark vintage, known for ripe, intensely flavored Rieslings, this auslese feels frail and faded at nearly 39 years old. Still, it offers a fascinating glimpse at Riesling's intensely mineral character, once the ebullience of its fruit and perfume have faded. Tasting now only a touch off dry, it's intensely dusty, saline and mineral, with a lean, slightly astringent finish.",88,101.0,Mosel,Anna Lee C.

Like the Kankana ultrapremium bottling, this wine is jammy and exotic smelling, with mulchy notes, rubber and horsey aromas.

Because it's not like a Napa, Washington or Chilean Cabernet that oozes cassis, plum and sweet French oak. Instead, it shows the terroir of the Mas La Plana vineyard in northeast Spain, and with airing (decanting even better) it becomes a sexy, interesting, Old World Cabernet that delivers provoking, earthier flavors.

13351,France,"There's good density here. This wine shows plenty of ripe Merlot fruit flavors, jammy, lifted with dried fruits and blackberries. It's a rounded, ripe wine, but shot through with a curious, unbalanced, very dry wood element.",85,17.0,Bordeaux,Roger Voss,Baron Philippe de Rothschild 2005 Mouton Cadet Réserve  (Saint-Émilion),Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Baron Philippe de Rothschild
13352,Spain,"Admittedly it's a bit late to be reviewing this 2005 Verdejo, but it's still fairly vital as it shows waxy citrus aromas in front of plump but anonymous white fruit.

13362,Spain,"More sharp and jumpy than many over-$20 wines from the region, but if you like a more racy, acidic style it may be up your alley.

And it's been a while (1999) since we last tasted it; this version is ripe, a bit hard and very, very serious.

There is noticeable volatility in the opening aromas, which slowly blows off and turns into concentrated raspberry, boysenberry, plum and cherry compote fruit. Dense and buoyed with firm acids, this wine needs a full 24 hours to smooth out. There is plenty of well-managed oak, adding smoky coffee and espresso to the finish.",90,45.0,Washington,Paul Gregutt,Dunham 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon X Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),Cabernet Sauvignon,Dunham

13572,Chile,"A nosing reveals pineapple juice; it's a bit too forward and sharp. In the mouth, lemony flavors mix with buttery oak. It finishes heavier than it should, but still it's pretty clean.

13576,Chile,"A flat bouquet smells mostly of root beer, grass and herbal black fruits. This is chunky and lacking a central point of reference.
